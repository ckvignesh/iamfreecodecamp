          <Title>The Challenge</Title>
          <div className="text-3xl p-12 mt-8 border bg-blue-500 text-gray-500">
            The main idea behind this (triple) challenge is to increase
            sustainability of the nonprofit and invest our time contributing to
            freeCodeCamp in 3 distinct vectors:
            <div className="p-4">ðŸ’° Donate</div>
            <div className="p-4">ðŸŒˆ Mentor students</div>
            <div className="p-4">ðŸ’™ Meet alumni</div>
          </div>
          <div className="pt-8">
            This challenge is mostly directioned to Alumni, but students can
            also participate.
          </div>
          <div className="pt-8">
            So, if you&apos;re a Student you can start to pay it forward (if you
            have the possiblity, of course) accepting the first challenge! You
            can also follow @iAmFreeCodeCamp so that you can find a mentor
            (alumni) to help you guide your way through learning how to code!
          </div>
          <div className="pt-8">
            If you are an Alumni, you already work in the industry and have some
            experience. You&apos;re ready to take the 3 challenges! Donate,
            mentor a student and meet your colleagues! Have fun!
          </div>
          <div className="pt-8">We&apos;ll all be winning in the end!</div>
          <Title>The Rules</Title>
          <div

            <div>
              You choose if you want to donate $5, $50 or $500 USD. What&apos;s
              really important is that you keep donating every month in a
              consistent way.

              Tweet monthly about your donation (keep the value secret,

              being freeCodeCamp. This way we can motivate more and more people
              to do it with us.

              You choose if you want to mentor one or more students. What&apos;s
              important here is to provide some guidance and answer in a more
              intimate way to all the questions students might have about
              learning to code, career change, jobs, skills, age, etc.
