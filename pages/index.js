          <div className="pt-8">Hi all üëã !</div>
          <div className="pt-8">
            2020 wasn&apos;t an easy year and 2021 promises to keep us
            struggling to surpass the pandemic and a global economic crisis. A
            lot of us are grieving their family and friends. Others lost their
            jobs and are looking up for solutions to put food on the table.
          </div>
          <div className="pt-8">
            These are particular difficult times for everyone. With this in mind
            I&apos;ve started to think - in late December (2020) - on how could
            I help people worldwide.
          </div>
          <div className="pt-8">
            <a
              className="underline hover:no-underine"
              href="https://freecodecamp.org">
              freeCodeCamp
            </a>{' '}
            immediately came up to my mind as I always feel so privileged for
            having a stable and safe software consultancy business.
          </div>
          <div className="pt-8">
            By the way, you can read my story{' '}
            <a
              className="underline hover:nounderline"
              href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/from-civil-engineer-to-web-developer-with-freecodecamp/">
              here
            </a>
            . That&apos;s not much of a story but it&apos;s my own, and I felt
            it was meaningful to share it with the world.
          </div>
          <div className="pt-8">
            In the end I was so lucky on how freeCodeCamp changed my life that
            I&apos;ve decided to do a{' '}
            <span className="font-bold">brainstorm</span> to find ideas on how
            to help students to surpass their difficulties and get the
            appropriate slipstream to succeed.
          </div>
          <div className="pt-8">
            As a plus, with so many people loosing their jobs and looking for
            solutions to keep feeding their families I think there will be a
            great increase of students soon - it&apos; already happening - and
            this reiterates the fact that now is the time to{' '}
            <span className="font-bold">help more</span>!
          </div>
          <div className="text-3xl p-12 mt-8 border bg-blue-500 text-gray-50">
            &rdquo;As freeCodeCampers, what can we do to help other
            people?&rdquo;
          </div>
          <div className="pt-8">
            After some iteration and discussion I&apos;ve ended up with 3 main
            aspects I&apos;d enjoy to help with. And I think I&apos;ve got
            something for you. Yes, let&apos;s call it a{' '}
            <span className="font-bold">CHALLENGE</span>, as alone we&apos;re
            not able to do anything but together we can make the difference.
          </div>

          <div className="pt-8">
            Let&apos;s work hard to invest on freeCodeCamp through the leverage
            of 3 distinct vectors:
            <span className="font-bold"> Donate to freeCodeCamp</span>,
            <span className="font-bold"> Mentor Students</span> and
            <span className="font-bold"> Meet other Alumni</span>.
          </div>
          <div className="pt-8">
            We&apos;ll all be winning in the end and this is the importance of
            being freeCodeCamp and the beginning of the
            <span className="font-bold"> #iAmFreeCodeCamp</span> movement! üíô

            There are a lot of ways to contribute to freeCodeCamp and the work
            of this wide and active community has been huge! But in the end
            there&apos;s something we need to have in mind. This nonprofit
            budget is relatively small and only due to a transparent and
            effective management it was possible to provide everything it has
            provided till today. You can read more about it in this article -
