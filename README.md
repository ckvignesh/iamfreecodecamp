## Style guide

How to write on our site

A
alumni, alumnus - lower case.

N
Numbers one to nine spelled out. Use numerals for 10 and above.

## Website

The website is a Next.js app. It automatically deploys to Vercel when the master branch is updated.

## How you can run it on your local machine

- Clone the Repo.
- Run:
  ```
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```
  It will run on the [port 3000](http://localhost:3005) of your local machine, by default.

If you're umable to run it on Port 3000 due to any reason, you can run it on any other port.

For that, follow these steps:

- Go to the [package.json file](package.json).
- You'll see this line of code `"dev": "next"`.
- Replace `"next"` with `"next dev -p 3002"`. `3002` is the port you may want to use. You can use any number here but, remember to use it for the next steps in place of `3002`.
- It should look like this, now: `"dev": next dev -p 3002"`.
- Save the [package.json file](package.json) and go to your terminal.
- Type `npm run dev -- -p 3002` in your terminal. Now, the server will run on port 3002.
